# Old Crone's Computerwares

Dear wanderer, you are welcome here. 

My magic is self taught and mostly wrought by a human, thus mistakes live in little holes in he walls and squeak at me now and again. 

Personally, I wouldn't rely on this junk to work all the time and in every case, but if you do happen to find it useful, all the better.
